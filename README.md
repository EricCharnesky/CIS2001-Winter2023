## Course Description: 
This course presents techniques for the design, writing, testing, and debugging of medium-sized programs, and an introduction to data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists) using an object-oriented programming language for data science applications. Topics covered include pointers, templates, and inheritance. The principles of UML modeling are continued. This course will consist of three lecture hours and one two-hour laboratory. The labs will cover various data science applications. (F, W, S)

## Program Learning Goals:

## Course Objectives: 
a)	The student will be able to create simple test cases and test plans for unit and integration testing of medium-sized programs  
b)	The student will be able to create stub procedures and drivers as needed, to perform top-down or bottom-up integration testing of programs  
c)	The student will be able to describe the tradeoff considerations for data design implementations  
d)	The student will be able to design software to that it is easily modifiable  
e)	The student will be able to implement algorithms using linked lists, stacks, and queues  
f)	The student will be able to incorporate various sorting algorithms into program design  
g)	The student will be able to make use of an existing class library and create a program, using object-oriented analysis and object-oriented design techniques  
h)	The student will be able to use object-oriented design to create libraries of related classes that can be used to solve real-world problems  
i)	The student will be able to utilize data abstraction. data hiding, functions, and inheritance  
j)	The student will be able to work with the Unix file system and with Unix shell commands  
k)	The student will be able to write a medium-sized program as part of a team

## Academic Integrity Policy:
Although students are encouraged to help their classmates, students sharing code are guilty of plagiarism. If programs are considered too similar, the students will be asked to explain. The Dean will be notified about any such offenses as well as the Academic Code of Conduct Committee.   In all cases of cheating, students who supply code or take it will both be penalized. The penalty for all students involved in academic integrity violations is failure in the class.  Under no circumstances may sites like chegg.com be used, you may not cite them as a source.

## Late Projects & Homework: 
Will not be accepted without prior written approval.
